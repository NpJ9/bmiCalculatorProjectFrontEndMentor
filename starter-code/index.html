                healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, 
                such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced 
                fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, 
                strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for
